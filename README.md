Should open in browser (y/n): n
```

### Cli
- Optional args (must come before link as positional arg)
    - `-b` Prompts you to open link in browser, then will open link in browser
    - `-c` Will copy resulting link to clipboard (NOTE: only tested on MacOS as of now)
- Positional arg is shortened link
- Example `(executable) -b -c [shortened link here]`

### Simple webserver
- Simple `docker` setup using `docker-compose` and `nginx` as a proxy
- To start: `docker-compose up --build` and navigate to [http://localhost](http://localhost) in browser
- Example running on a small GCE instance [here](http://35.230.68.216/) - if the IP address has changed, oh well, it's not reserved
